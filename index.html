                <h1> Frogs </h1>
                <p>   A frog is any member of a diverse and <br/>largely carnivorous group of short-bodied,<br/> tailless amphibians composing the order<br/> Anura. The oldest fossil "proto-frog"<br/>Triadobatrachus is known from the Early<br/> Triassic ofMadagascar, but molecular<br/> clock dating suggests their split from other<br/> amphibians may extend further back to the Permian, 265 million years ago.<br/> Frogs are widely distributed, ranging<br/> from the tropics to subarctic regions,<br/> but the greatest concentration of species<br/> diversity is in tropical rainforest. Frogs<br/> account for around88% of extant amphibian species. They are also one of the five<br/> most diverse vertebrate orders. Warty frog<br/> species tend to be called toads,<br/> but the distinction between frogs and<br/> toads is informal, not from taxonomy or<br/> evolutionary history.</p>
